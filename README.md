# understand.ai Anonymizer

To improve privacy and make it easier for companies to comply with GDPR, we at [understand.ai](understand.ai) are open-sourcing our anonymization software in the upcoming days.

Along with the software we will open-source weights for a model trained on our in-house datasets for faces and license plates. To make it easy for everyone to use these weights in their own projects the model is trained with [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

Our anonymizer is used for projects with some of Germany's largest car manufacturers and suppliers, but we are sure there are many more applications.
We are looking forward to a widespread use and would love to hear your feedback.
Feel free to contact us with any questions at anonymizer@understand.ai.
